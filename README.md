# GoDC-TELKOM-Project
This repository serves as the official learning resource curated for members of the Mobile Developer Division on Google Developer Club, Telkom University. It is designed to establish a solid foundational understanding of the Dart programming language, which plays a central role in modern mobile development, particularly within the Flutter ecosystem.

The learning structure presented here is methodically developed to be comprehensive, academically rigorous, and industry-aligned. The content supports both self-paced learning and structured internal training sessions, ensuring that members gain a deep conceptual understanding of Dart’s core principles—ranging from fundamental syntax to object-oriented paradigms and asynchronous programming.

By mastering the material in this repository, members are expected to develop clean coding habits, acquire strong theoretical and practical proficiency, and be fully prepared to transition into developing scalable, maintainable, and production-grade mobile applications using Flutter.
